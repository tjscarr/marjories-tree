## Welcome ...

**Family Tree Roots** is a project born from discussing family tree's during christmas 2024. 

This is intended to be a collaborative, family project. 

Credit for the initial work on dicovering lineages for the Scarr family goes to <a href="/people/12" >Robert Scarr</a>, who spent countless hours trawling websites and archives for information dating back to the 16th Century. 

Likewise, meticulous work on the Reeves lineage was originally provided by <a href="/people/114"> Paula Woods</a>, whose kind gift of her work along with a family calendar triggered the start of this project. 

I intend  to evolve this project beyond it's current implementation to include capabilities for:
* Storing and sharing evidence and documents
* Linking significant places and events
* Submitting images of significant events, places or gatherings
I'd love to collaborate on any further extensions.

If you have any ideas or questions feel free to contact me at <a href= "tom@littledatacompany.com">tom@littledatacompany.com</a>

Please feel free to email <a href= "tom@littledatacompany.com">tom@littledatacompany.com</a> if there is anyone you would like to invite . Once invited users should be able to add people, correct information and upload images to your heart's content.

I hope you enjoy this project,
<a href="/people/2" >Tom Scarr</a>
